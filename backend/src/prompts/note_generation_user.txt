Based on the previous conversation between the user and assistant, generate content to be appended to the user's notes.

Previous conversation:
{conversation_content}

Instructions:
1. Extract the key learning points, explanations, and insights from the conversation
2. Format everything in proper Markdown syntax
3. Use appropriate headers (##, ###), bullet points, code blocks, etc.
4. Make it comprehensive but well-organized
5. Include examples if they were discussed
6. Structure it as a standalone section that can be appended to existing notes

Generate ONLY the markdown content to be added to the note - no explanatory text, no "Here's what to add" - just the clean markdown content that should be appended.
