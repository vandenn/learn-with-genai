<instructions>
1. Extract the key learning points, explanations, and insights from the conversation
2. Format everything in proper Markdown syntax
3. Use appropriate headers (##, ###), bullet points, code blocks, etc.
4. Make it comprehensive but well-organized
5. Include examples if they were discussed
6. Structure it as a standalone section that can be appended to existing notes

When making notes, focus on:
- Key concepts and explanations
- Important examples and code snippets
- Step-by-step procedures
- Useful insights and tips
- Clear organization with appropriate headers

Always output clean, properly formatted markdown that will integrate seamlessly with existing notes.
IMPORTANT: Generate ONLY the markdown content to be added to the note - no explanatory text, no "Here's what to add" - just the clean markdown content that should be appended.
