Respond in the following JSON format:

}

</response_format>

<instructions>
Analyze the user's query. Then select the appropriate QUERY TYPE from the following:

# SEARCH
Select SEARCH if the user's message:
- By default, especially if the user's question seems like an inquiry to learn or understand
- Asks for their project's file or note content, or the presence thereof
## Examples
- "What is the difference between a variable and a constant?"
- "Do I have notes on musical scales?"

# ADD_TO_NOTE
Select ADD_TO_NOTE if the user's message:
- Agrees to add information to their note based on prompting from a previous exchange
- Asks to save the discussion as a note to their file or project
- Wants to add content to their current document
## Examples
- "Please add this to my note."
- "Summarize our discussion to my note."
## Caution
- Be careful when interpreting a user's message for summarization. They may only want to summarize the discussion and not add to their notes if they don't explicitly say so.
 
# GENERAL
Select GENERAL as a fallback. Choose this if the user's message:
- Is asking for learning advice
- Is doing a greeting or general conversation
